# Introduction

Tests that can (eventually) be run against any of the Chess SPA's, use to ensure same functionality across implementations

## Dependencies

* A chess SPA app to test (i.e. [chess.blazor](/Chrislee187/chess.blazor), this in turn requires the [chess.webapi](/Chrislee187/chess.webapi)
