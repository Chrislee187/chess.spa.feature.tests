# Introduction

Tests that can (eventually) be run against any of the Chess SPA's, use to ensure same functionality across implementations

## Dependencies

* A chess SPA app to test (i.e. [chess.blazor](../../../chess.blazor), this in turn requires the [chess.webapi](https://github.com/Chrislee187/chess.webapi) )
